## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, **https://echen0719.github.io**. This website will serves as a simple introduction to myself. I would like to make my website as beatiful, creative, and interesting as possible.

## Project Structure

The website uses basic HTML, CSS, and potentially Javascript for any interactive elements.

The following is a general breakdown of the expected file structure:

* **index.html**: The main page of the website.
* **blog/blog.html**: Main pages about my blog
* **blog/***:  Folder with blogs, including articles
* **projects/projects.html**: Main page about my projects.
* **projects/***: Folder with projects including subfolders
* **aboutme.html**: Basic information about me.
* **contacts.html**: My contact information.
* More ideas will come

* **style.css**: Contains the stylesheets for the website's design.

* **script.js**: Creates an interactive place for users.

* **images/***: Folder containing any images used on the website.

* **images/favicon.ico**: The website's favicon.

  ... and possibly so much more.

## Software

Currently, I use **Kate (KDE)** and **VS Studio Code** to write the HTML, CSS, and JS needed for this website.

This site was built using [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). The files for this website are found in this repository.
