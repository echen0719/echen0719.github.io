##Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, https://echen0719.github.io. This website will serves as a simple introduction to myself. I would like to make my website as beatiful, creative, and interesting as possible.

##Project Structure

The website uses basic HTML, CSS, and potentially Javascript for any interactive elements.

The following is a general breakdown of the expected file structure:

    **index.html**: The main page of the website.
    **style.css**: Contains the stylesheets for the website's design.
    **script.js**: Creates an interactive place for users.
    **images**: Folder containing any images used on the website.
    **favicon.ico**: The website's favicon.
    ... and possibly more.
