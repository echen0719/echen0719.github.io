## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, **https://echen0719.github.io**. This website will serves as a simple introduction to myself. I would like to make my website as beatiful, creative, and interesting as possible.

## Project Structure

The website uses basic HTML, CSS, and potentially Javascript for any interactive elements.

The following is a general breakdown of the expected file structure:

* **index.html**: The main page of the website.
* **aboutme.html**: Basic information about me.
* **projects.html**: Projects I have worked on.
* **contacts.html**: My contact information.
* **faqs.html**: Questions that people may have.

* **style.css**: Contains the stylesheets for the website's design.

* **script.js**: Creates an interactive place for users.

* **images**: Folder containing any images used on the website.

* **favicon.ico**: The website's favicon.

  ... and possibly so much more.

## Software

Currently, I use **Notepad++** and **VS Studio Code** to write and compile the HTML, CSS, and JS needed for this website.

This site was built using [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). The files for this website are found in this repository.
