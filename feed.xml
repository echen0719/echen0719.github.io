You are probably using it right now. If you haven’t heard of it, you are probably living under a massive rock or mountain. Anyways, I feel like Windows is a good “do-it-all” operating system that functions well for its designed purpose. However, not every operating system is perfect and Windows definitely needs some renovation.</p> <div id="desktop-os_combined-ww-monthly-202409-202509" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; height: 400px;"></div> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.statcounter.com/js/fusioncharts.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?desktop-os_combined-ww-monthly-202409-202509&amp;chartWidth=600"></script> <h2 id="problem-1-data-collection">Problem 1: Data Collection</h2> <p>This is definitely I of the things I hate about using Windows. From the first screen of installation to everyday use, you always see Microsoft asking for your personal information for advertisements. I am not happy about that at all. I am sure people want to limit how much information they are sharing with proprietary companies. After all, it is them that are earning in that green paper, not you.</p> <p>There is some data collection I am fine with Windows collecting – such as telemetry to improve their operating systems, but I do not need them to know that I like playing Counter-Strike so I receive a cluttered feed of skin markets. Also, collecting data and sending it can be taxing for some computers and it just adds an unnecessary feature that older computers might not be able to handle.</p> <p>What should Microsoft do? Be more upfront with their permission to harvest user data and let them choose what information they want to send (telemetry, preferences, searches, etc.) and allow users to more easily disable/delete data collection apps.</p> <h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2:</h2> <p>###</p> <h2 id="problem-3">Problem 3:</h2> <p>###</p> <h2 id="problem-4">Problem 4:</h2> <p>###</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A short post on problems that I find with Windows]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World!</title><link href="https://echen0719.github.io/blog/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World!"/><published>2025-04-27T09:21:12+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-27T09:21:12+00:00</updated><id>https://echen0719.github.io/blog/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://echen0719.github.io/blog/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Welcome to my blog! It might empty for now until I add a few more posts in the future. Anyways, this is my <strong>first ever</strong> attempt at writing to an audience that I don’t know.</p> <p>I am writing these blogs as a way to communicate my experiences with the outside world. Blogging gives me an open area to share my thoughts and successes on the internet with you (currently reading this) and perhaps someone across the world. In addition, the opportunity to blog could improve my writing abilities and how I deliver information.</p> <p>However, I am still really new to the idea of blogging. After all, this is my first time diving into this experience. Even setting up the blog itself on Github Pages was somewhat a pain. But, I lived through 🙂. On that [sine/cosine]*, I am using al-folio as the Jekyll theme since it has many features that I can use, such as this blog page and the projects page.</p> <p>* get it? sine/cosine = tangent</p> <h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect?</h2> <p>If you have seen my about page, you probably know that I am enthusiastic for <strong>computer science</strong>, <strong>chemistry</strong>, and some mathematics and cybersecurity. I also have other hobbies outside of these zones such as cross country and track. I plan to dedicate this blog to sharing my thoughts on these various topics.</p> <p>I expect myself to post around once a month. That frequency would obviously vary depending on how much coursework I have and the time that I have avaliable. However, a dedication is a dedication. I hope to make my blog posts interesting for you guys to read.</p> <hr/> <p>Well, thanks for reading my first ever blog posts and I hope you have a nice day :D</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First ever blog page!]]></summary></entry></feed>
