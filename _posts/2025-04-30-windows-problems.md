You probably already heard about Microsoft Windows -- the operating system that around <strong>three quarters (75%!)</strong> of desktops are running right now. You are probably using it right now. If you haven't heard of it, you are probably living under a massive rock or mountain. Anyways, I feel like Windows is a good "do-it-all" operating system that functions well for its designed purpose. However, not every operating system is perfect and Windows definitely needs some renovation.
