You probably already heard about Microsoft Windows -- the operating system that more than three quarters of personal computers are running right now. You are probably using it right now. If you haven't heard of it, you are probably living under a massive rock or mountain. Anyways, I feel like Windows is a good "do-it-all" operating system that functions well for its designed purpose. However, not every operating system is perfect and Windows definitely needs some renovation.
