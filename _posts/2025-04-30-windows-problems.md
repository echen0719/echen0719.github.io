You probably already heard about Microsoft Windows -- the operating system that around <strong>three quarters (75%!)</strong> of desktops are running right now. You are probably using it right now. If you haven't heard of it, you are probably living under a massive rock or mountain. Anyways, I feel like Windows is a good "do-it-all" operating system that functions well for its designed purpose. However, not every operating system is perfect and Windows definitely needs some renovation.

## Problem 1: Data Collection

This is definitely I of the things I hate about using Windows. From the first screen of installation to everyday use, you always see Microsoft asking for your personal information for advertisements. I am not happy about that at all. I am sure people want to limit how much information they are sharing with proprietary companies. After all, it is them that are earning in that green paper, not you.

There is some data collection I am fine with Windows collecting -- such as telemetry to improve their operating systems, but I do not need them to know that I like playing Counter-Strike so I receive a cluttered feed of skin markets. Also, collecting data and sending it can be taxing for some computers and it just adds an unnecessary feature that older computers might not be able to handle.

What should Microsoft do? Be more upfront with their permission to harvest user data and let them choose what information they want to send (telemetry, preferences, searches, etc.) and allow users to more easily disable/delete data collection apps.
