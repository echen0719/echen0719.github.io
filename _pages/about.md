**Welcome and nice to meet you!** My name is Eric and I am currently a sophomore attending <a href='https://www.ebnet.org'>East Brunswick HS</a>. My interests lie within practical uses of unsupervised and supervised learning and applying algorithms to increase performance on software. I am currently spending my time learning the general knowledges of *machine learning* and *software development*.
